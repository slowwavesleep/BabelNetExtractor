Note that the wordforms ""round"" and ""around"" have a complex distribution; in British English, ""round"" is used in all but the most formal registers, while in American, ""round"" is used only in very informal registers, and only when not preceded by adverbs like ""right"".  ""Round"" is especially common in American in the phrase ""round and round"".  In American, ""round"" is essentially impossible in bare adverb uses, like ""run around"".  British apparently prefers ""around"" in cases of indefinite location, as in ""wandering around the park"" and (metaphorically) ""around 20 euros"", while overwhelmingly using ""round"" when used in senses pertaining to turning, as in ""turn round"", ""came round the corner""."
